# Fonts

the original PDF document 2021 CASA May Competition Program 
uses ArialMT and Arial-BoldMT. But [this page](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14833/is-it-okay-to-use-the-arial-font-in-software) 
says Arial is propriatary and expensive. It says Arial is 
basically a copy of Helvetica; but Helvetica is also expensive.

However that page does suggest [Arimo](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/arimo) which is available under an Apache license.

Also, [this page](https://envato.com/blog/death-of-helvetica-rise-of-the-bespoke-font/) suggets
Google's [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto#license) 
which is also under the Apache license.
